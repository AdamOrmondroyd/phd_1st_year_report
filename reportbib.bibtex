  abstract      = "We present three non-parametric Bayesian primordial
                   reconstructions using Planck 2018 polarization data: linear
                   spline primordial power spectrum reconstructions, cubic
                   spline inflationary potential reconstructions and
                   sharp-featured primordial power spectrum reconstructions.
                   All three methods conditionally show hints of an oscillatory
                   feature in the primordial power spectrum in the multipole
                   range $\ell\sim20$ to $\ell\sim50$, which is to some extent
                   preserved upon marginalization. We find no evidence for
                   deviations from a pure power law across a broad observable
                   window ($50\lesssim\ell\lesssim2000$), but find that
                   parameterizations are preferred which are able to account
                   for lack of resolution at large angular scales due to cosmic
                   variance, and at small angular scales due to Planck
                   instrument noise. Furthermore, the late-time cosmological
                   parameters are unperturbed by these extensions to the
                   primordial power spectrum. This work is intended to provide
                   a background and give more details of the Bayesian
                   primordial reconstruction work found in the Planck 2018
                   papers.",

    abstract = "{Evaluating the log-sum-exp function or the softmax function is a key step in many modern data science algorithms, notably in inference and classification. Because of the exponentials that these functions contain, the evaluation is prone to overflow and underflow, especially in low-precision arithmetic. Software implementations commonly use alternative formulas that avoid overflow and reduce the chance of harmful underflow, employing a shift or another rewriting. Although mathematically equivalent, these variants behave differently in floating-point arithmetic and shifting can introduce subtractive cancellation. We give rounding error analyses of different evaluation algorithms and interpret the error bounds using condition numbers for the functions. We conclude, based on the analysis and numerical experiments, that the shifted formulas are of similar accuracy to the unshifted ones, so can safely be used, but that a division-free variant of softmax can suffer from loss of accuracy.}",

	abstract = {The preferred shape for the primordial spectrum of curvature perturbations is determined by performing a Bayesian model selection analysis of cosmological observations. We first reconstruct the spectrum modelled as piecewise linear in log k between nodes in k-space whose amplitudes and positions are allowed to vary. The number of nodes together with their positions are chosen by the Bayesian evidence, so that we can both determine the complexity supported by the data and locate any features present in the spectrum. In addition to the node-based reconstruction, we consider a set of parameterised models for the primordial spectrum: the standard power-law parameterisation, the spectrum produced from the Lasenby & Doran (LD) model and a simple variant parameterisation. By comparing the Bayesian evidence for different classes of spectra, we find the power-law parameterisation is significantly disfavoured by current cosmological observations, which show a preference for the LD model.}

We show that combining the supernova type Ia observations with the constraints from WMAP observations restricts large variation of ρ(z) at low redshifts. The combination of these two observational constraints is stronger than either one. The results are completely consistent with the cosmological constant as the source of dark energy.}",
